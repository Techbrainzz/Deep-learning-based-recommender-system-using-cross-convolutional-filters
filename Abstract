Recommender systems have gotten more and more attention as online transactions have recently developed in a variety of fields. By recommending options that are more likely to be preferred, the recommender system aids users in their decision-making. The complicated interplay between user and item attributes have been the focus of numerous studies in the field of deep learning-based recommender systems.

Traditional recommender systems have limitations when the user has purchased a very small number of items, when a new user (or item) is added, or when a very large amount of data is needed to be analysed. Also, traditional recommender systems cannot effectively model certain types of content information such as texts and images provided by users or for items. In addition to this, the sparsity of data and the cold start problems also exists in the traditional recommender systems.

In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based recommender system that makes use of cross convolutional filters and the outer product matrix of features. The suggested approach can handle a variety of feature types and record relevant higher-order interactions between users and products, giving important features more weight. Additionally, since the global average or max pooling is used in the suggested method rather than fully connected layers in the structure, it can help with the overfitting issue. The suggested method outperforms previous methods, according to experiments, by capturing crucial interactions and resolving the overfitting problem.
